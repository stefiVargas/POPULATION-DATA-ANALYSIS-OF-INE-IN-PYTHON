###

The objective of this project is to analysis the data population over the years. We started connecting to the database of the Spanish National Statistics Institute, commonly known as INE.
After establishing the connection, we retrieve a dataset containing population data from Spain. Subsequently, our task involves .Extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating and visualizing insights.
The aim is to draw conclusions about how the Spanish population has been changing over the years.
